## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The automation starts via the Appilot dashboard, where users define message templates, triggers (like “new message received” or “order shipped”), and target accounts.  
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot interacts with the eBay app using UI Automator or Accessibility APIs to open chats, type responses, and send messages.  
3. **Output or Action** — The bot delivers personalized replies, logs interaction timestamps, and updates engagement metrics in the dashboard.  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Retry logic, analytics logging, and parallel processing ensure consistent operation across hundreds of conversations.
